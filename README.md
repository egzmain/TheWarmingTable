# TheWarmingTable

TWT is a Unity-based interactive shopping experience designed to raise awareness about the environmental impact of consumer choices. Users interact with a virtual grocery store, where every selected food item updates real-time carbon and calorie counters. The environment reacts dynamically—such as rising ocean levels—based on the player's cumulative CO2 output.
